The player selects one of two options: 'banker' or 'player'. After drawing two cards, the participant with the number closest to 9 emerges as the winner.

If the total exceeds 9, an extra card will be drawn from the deck. Yet, if the initial two draws yield a sum of 8 or 9, the dealer will cease drawing any additional cards.
